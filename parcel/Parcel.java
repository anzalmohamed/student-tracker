//Create a basic application that prompts users to provide the dimensions and weight of a package. Then, return the cost to ship the package

// Create a Parcel class.
// You should be able to create a new Parcel and specify the dimensions and weight in the arguments.
// Create a volume() method that calculates the volume of a Parcel using its dimensions.
// Then, create a costToShip() method that returns how much this Parcel will cost to ship somewhere, based on a formula you make up.
// Your formula may consider factors like speed of delivery, distance, dimensions, weight, etc.
// Further Exploration
// If you finish the functionality listed above with time to spare, work on the following additional functionalities:

// Offer gift wrapping services that require the surface area of the parcel to determine cost.
// Offer discounts based on size, date or some other property.
// Add functionality to your command line interface that allows your program to continually run, as seen previously on the lesson on multiple functionalities in a command line application found on this day. Keep track of all parcels, and provide the user an option to see a list of every Parcel object created. (Note: Until we integrate databases in week 3, we won't be able to retain data if we quit and re-start a program. This is normal.)
